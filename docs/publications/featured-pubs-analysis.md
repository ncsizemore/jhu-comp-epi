**PDF:** `docs/publications/hyle-2023.pdf`

### Key Figure Recommendation
**Figure 2** (pages 4-5) - "The projected age distribution, age, and numbers of MSM on ART from the CEPAC-US and PEARL models (2021–2031)"
- Four-panel figure showing age distributions and population growth
- Panels C & D show dramatic growth in MSM ≥65 years (highlighted sections)
- Comparison of two independent models validates findings
- Clear visualization of aging population on ART

### Drafted Key Findings
"Two independent microsimulation models project that MSM on antiretroviral therapy in the US will more than double from ~60,000 to over 110,000-147,000 individuals aged 65+ by 2031. This dramatic aging of the HIV population underscores the need for healthcare systems to prepare for rising multimorbidity and complex medical decision-making."

### Notes
- Model comparison study (CEPAC-US vs PEARL)
- Both models agree on aging trend despite different assumptions
- MSM represent >66% of new HIV diagnoses and ~55% of PWH in care
- Focus on one demographic (MSM) rather than all PWH

## The Three Studies Together: A Policy Research Trilogy

These three studies form a comprehensive examination of potential HIV program disruptions:

1. **Forster 2025** (Published, Ann Intern Med): Complete cessation of Ryan White → 75,436 excess infections (49% increase) in 31 cities
2. **Zalesak 2025** (Preprint): Cuts to Ryan White Parts C/D/MAI/EHE → 23,883 excess infections (17.6% increase) in 30 states + DC
3. **Balasubramanian 2025** (Preprint): Ending CDC testing → 12,719 excess infections (10% increase) in 18 states

**Common Themes:**
- All use JHEEM model with local-level calibration
- All demonstrate compounding effects over time
- All show disproportionate impact on rural and underserved communities
- All emphasize long-term consequences even from temporary disruptions
- Interactive web tools for all three studies

## 9. Fojo 2022 - COVID-19 and HIV

**Full Title:** Potential Effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Transmission: A Modeling Study in 32 US Cities

**Authors:** Anthony Fojo, Emma Wallengren, Melissa Schnure, David W. Dowdy, Maunank Shah, and Parastu Kasaie

**Journal:** Clinical Infectious Diseases

**Year:** 2022 (published online 7 January 2022, Volume 75(1): e1145-e1153)

**DOI:** [10.1093/cid/ciab1029](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab1029)

**Link:** https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab1029

**PDF:** `docs/publications/fojo-2022-covid-hiv.pdf`

### Key Figure Recommendation

**Figure 2** (page 4) - "Projected incidence (solid lines) and reported diagnoses (dashed lines), according to potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual transmission and viral suppression"
- 8-panel figure showing "optimistic" vs "pessimistic" simulations across multiple cities
- Panels show: All 32 MSAs, San Diego, Boston, and Chicago with different scenarios
- Demonstrates divergence between incidence and reported diagnoses during pandemic
- Gray lines show COVID-19 scenario, black lines show no-pandemic baseline
- Clearly illustrates uncertainty ranges and the disconnect between diagnoses and actual transmission

**Alternative: Figure 3** - Heat maps showing impact of reductions in sexual transmission and viral suppression on cumulative HIV incidence (2020-2025) across cities

**Alternative: Figure 4** - Box plots showing change in cumulative incidence by city under different scenarios

### Drafted Key Findings

"The effects of COVID-19 on HIV transmission remain uncertain and differ between cities. Under optimistic scenarios where sexual transmission decreased and healthcare access was maintained, HIV incidence could fall 8% (95% CrI: 14% lower to no change), while pessimistic scenarios with maintained transmission but disrupted care could increase incidence 11% (1-21% higher). Critically, reported HIV diagnoses are likely to correlate poorly with underlying incidence in 2020-2021, with diagnoses dropping then rebounding regardless of actual transmission trends."

**Authors:** Bohdan Nosyk, Anthony Todd Fojo, Parastu Kasaie, Benjamin Enns, Laura Trigg, Micah Piske, Angela B. Hutchinson, Elizabeth A. DiNenno, Xiao Zang, and Carlos del Rio

**Journal:** Clinical Infectious Diseases (VIEWPOINTS section)

**Year:** 2023 (Volume 76(12): 2206-2208)

**DOI:** [10.1093/cid/ciad103](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciad103)

**Link:** https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciad103

**PDF:** `docs/publications/nosykb-2023.pdf`

### Key Figure Recommendation

**Figure 1** (page 2) - "Total testing volumes and test positivity of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded HIV tests (2013-2020)"
- Bar chart showing CDC-funded test volumes (left axis) from 2013-2020
- Line graph overlay showing test positivity percentage (right axis)
- Clear visualization of dramatic 56% decline in testing from 2015 to 2020
- Shows positivity rate remained relatively stable (0.41% to 0.48%) despite volume changes
- Highlights impact of COVID-19 pandemic on 2020 testing volumes

### Summary of Key Arguments

This VIEWPOINTS article makes the case that:
- Data from several modeling studies demonstrate that large-scale increases in HIV testing may produce the largest incidence reductions to support the US EHE initiative's goal of reducing new HIV infections 90% by 2030
- Despite CDC recommendations for routine HIV screening, fewer than half of US adults report ever receiving an HIV test
- CDC-funded HIV tests dropped dramatically: 3,026,074 (2015) → 1,338,665 (2020) — a 56% decline
- Total domestic funding for HIV prevention has remained flat from 2013-2019
- Fojo et al. (2021) estimated biannual testing for MSM/PWID and annual testing for heterosexuals would yield 55% decline in HIV incidence
- Nosyk et al. (2020) found 62% increase in monthly testing rate would generate long-term cost savings
- Three-quarters of those receiving a new HIV diagnosis through CDC-funded tests are linked to care within 30 days
- HIV testing represents excellent value for money so long as yield exceeds 0.1% (CDC-funded tests had 0.48% yield in 2020)

### Notes
- Viewpoints/commentary article (not original research)
- Synthesizes findings from multiple modeling studies
- Published in Clinical Infectious Diseases
- Very policy-relevant: argues for renewed investment in HIV testing
- Emphasizes testing as rate-limiting step for EHE initiative success
- Discusses innovative approaches: self-testing kits, lotteries, integration with other preventive diagnostics
- Compares HIV testing expansion to COVID-19 vaccination strategies
- Short format (3 pages), highly readable
- Key quote: "Simply put, far more individuals need to be tested to approach the ambitious EHE targets."

**Full Title:** Forecasting the effect of HIV-targeted interventions on the age distribution of people with HIV in Kenya

**Authors:** Melissa C. Schnure, Parastu Kasaie, David W. Dowdy, Becky L. Genberg, Emily A. Kendall, and Anthony T. Fojo

**Journal:** AIDS

**Year:** 2024 (Volume 38: 1375-1385)

**DOI:** [10.1097/QAD.0000000000003895](https://doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0000000000003895)

**Link:** https://doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0000000000003895

**PDF:** `docs/publications/schnuremc-2024.pdf`

### Key Figure Recommendation

**Figure 3** (page 6) - "Age structure of people with HIV in Kenya"
- Three-color bar chart comparing 2025 (blue), 2040 status quo (pink), and 2040 full intervention (green)
- Shows dramatic shift toward older age groups over 15 years
- Clear visual demonstration of aging HIV population
- Simple, clean design with age bands on x-axis and population counts on y-axis
- Highlights the 50+ age group expansion from 376,000 (26%) to 479,000 (34%) without intervention

**Alternative: Figure 2** (page 5) - Forecasted HIV incidence and prevalence under different scenarios (8 panels showing all ages, 0-14, 15-49, 50+)

**Alternative: Figure 4** (page 7) - Sensitivity analysis showing parameters most strongly associated with percentage of PWH over age 50

### Drafted Key Findings

"PWH in Kenya are forecasted to age over the next 15 years, with the median age increasing from 39 in 2025 to 43 in 2040 without intervention (46 with full HIV care scale-up). The population over age 50 will grow from 376,000 (26%) to 479,000 (34%), driven by declining new infections among younger ages and longer survival on ART. This demographic shift underscores Kenya's urgent need to integrate HIV care with screening and treatment for age-related noncommunicable diseases."

- JHEEM model adapted for Kenya (general population epidemic)
- Dynamic compartmental model stratified by age (5-year bands, 0-80+) and sex
- Calibrated to UNAIDS data 1990-2021 using Adaptive Metropolis sampling (MCMC approach)
- 1000 final simulations from 200,000 total (across 4 chains)
- Two scenarios: "status quo" vs "full intervention" (5 components: testing, engagement, viral suppression gain, maintenance, retention - all at 90% by 2030)
- Interventions scaled linearly from 2025 to full effect by 2030
- Key methodological strength: Age-specific and sex-specific calibration targets
- Sensitivity analysis found all-cause mortality (age 45-65+) most strongly associated with % PWH over 50
- Kenya-specific data sources: KDHS surveys, UNAIDS AIDSInfo, UN World Population Prospects
- Important limitation: Collapses rural/urban settings
- Policy relevance: Highlights need for NCD integration into HIV care
- Kenya context: 1.4 million PWH in 2021, >75% virally suppressed
- First author from Johns Hopkins
- Interactive web tool likely available (pattern from other JHEEM studies)
