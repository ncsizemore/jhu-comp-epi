- Color-coded stacked bar charts showing 0, 1, and ≥2 physical comorbidities

### Drafted Key Findings
"By 2030, 70% of people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy in the US will have multimorbidity (≥2 comorbidities), up from 63% in 2020. Mental health conditions (depression/anxiety) will affect 64%, while chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and dyslipidemia will see the largest increases, with significant variation across demographic subgroups."

### Notes
- Open access (PLoS) - no copyright concerns for figures
- PEARL model projections
- Very visual paper with multiple strong figures
- Conclusions section (page 13) emphasizes need for multidisciplinary care models

## 2. Hyle 2023 - Journal of Infectious Diseases

**Full Title:** A growing number of men who have sex with men aging with HIV (2021–2031): a comparison of two microsimulation models

**Authors:** EP Hyle, P Kasaie, T Stanic, E Humes, KP Reddy, P Rebeiro, E Schwamm, J Zhang, P Pei, C Stewart, KA Freedberg, A Mayor, L Yu, J Margolick, FM Shebl, M Silverberg, RP Walensky, KN Althoff

**Journal:** The Journal of Infectious Diseases

**Year:** 2023

**DOI:** [10.1093/infdis/jiac473](https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiac473)

**Link:** https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiac473

**PDF:** `docs/publications/hyle-2023.pdf`

### Key Figure Recommendation
**Figure 2** (pages 4-5) - "The projected age distribution, age, and numbers of MSM on ART from the CEPAC-US and PEARL models (2021–2031)"
- Four-panel figure showing age distributions and population growth
- Panels C & D show dramatic growth in MSM ≥65 years (highlighted sections)
- Comparison of two independent models validates findings
- Clear visualization of aging population on ART

### Drafted Key Findings
"Two independent microsimulation models project that MSM on antiretroviral therapy in the US will more than double from ~60,000 to over 110,000-147,000 individuals aged 65+ by 2031. This dramatic aging of the HIV population underscores the need for healthcare systems to prepare for rising multimorbidity and complex medical decision-making."

### Notes
- Model comparison study (CEPAC-US vs PEARL)
- Both models agree on aging trend despite different assumptions
- MSM represent >66% of new HIV diagnoses and ~55% of PWH in care
- Focus on one demographic (MSM) rather than all PWH
- Sensitivity analyses identified engagement in care and mortality as key parameters

## 3. Althoff 2021 - AIDS

**Full Title:** The shifting age distribution of people with HIV using antiretroviral therapy in the United States, 2020 to 2030

**Authors:** Althoff KN, Stewart CN, Humes E, Zhang J, Gerace L, Boyd CM, Wong C, Justice AC, Gebo K, Thorne JE, Rubtsova AA, Horberg MA, Silverberg MJ Leng SX, Rebeiro PF, Moore RD, Buchacz K, Kasaie P

**Journal:** AIDS

**Year:** 2021

**DOI:** [10.1097/QAD.0000000000003128](https://doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0000000000003128)

**Link:** https://doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0000000000003128

**PDF:** `docs/publications/althoff-2021.pdf`

### Key Figure Recommendation
**Figure 3a** (page 15) - "Projected age distributions of people with HIV using ART in the United States in 2010, 2020, and 2030"
- Shows overall age distribution evolution with clear median age markers (46y→50y→52y)
- Demonstrates the dramatic shift from unimodal (2010) to bimodal distribution (2020, 2030)
- Visually striking with overlapping distributions in blue (2010), purple (2020), and red (2030)
- Includes validation against NA-ACCORD 2010 observed data (black dots)

**Alternative: Figure 3b** - Shows age distributions broken down by 15 subgroups (sex, HIV risk, race/ethnicity), demonstrating heterogeneity across populations

### Drafted Key Findings
"By 2030, the US will have over 900,000 people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy, with a median age of 52 years and 23% aged 65 or older. The age distribution will evolve from unimodal to bimodal, with significant heterogeneity across demographic groups, underscoring the critical need to prepare healthcare systems for an aging HIV population with increasing multimorbidity."

### Notes
- PEARL model projections (agent-based simulation)
- Validated against NA-ACCORD observed data (2010-2017)
- Projects both baseline scenario and EHE75% scenario (75% reduction in diagnoses)
- Multiple excellent figures available (Figures 2, 3a-d, 4a-c all strong candidates)
- Key point from page 12: "Even if EHE goals are achieved, healthcare systems must be readied to meet the needs of a large population of people aging with HIV"
- Conclusion emphasizes healthcare system preparedness for aging population
- Published in AIDS journal (may need permission for figure reuse)

## 4. Fojo 2021 - Annals of Internal Medicine

**Full Title:** What Will It Take to End HIV in the United States? A Comprehensive, Local-Level Modeling Study

**Authors:** Fojo AT, Schnure M, Kasaie P, Dowdy DW, Shah M

**Journal:** Annals of Internal Medicine

**Year:** 2021

**DOI:** [10.7326/M21-1501](https://doi.org/10.7326/M21-1501)

**Link:** https://doi.org/10.7326/M21-1501

**PDF:** `docs/publications/fojo-2021-end-hiv.pdf`

### Key Figure Recommendation
**Figure 4** (page 19) - "Reduction in HIV incidence from 2020 to 2030 for intervention scenarios across 32 MSAs"
- Heat map showing percentage reduction in HIV incidence across 32 metropolitan areas
- Color-coded cells (red→orange→yellow→green) showing effectiveness of different intervention combinations
- Compares 17 different intervention scenarios across all EHE priority cities
- Demonstrates heterogeneity in what works in different locations
- Shows progression from targeted (young Black/Hispanic MSM) to broad interventions

**Alternative: Figure 3** - Shows projected incidence and diagnoses in NYC for specific intervention scenarios with timeline

### Drafted Key Findings
"Ending the HIV epidemic will require substantial investment beyond current trends. Across 32 priority US cities, modest increases in testing, PrEP coverage, and viral suppression could reduce HIV incidence by 34-67% by 2030. Only 13 of 32 cities could achieve the 90% reduction goal even with intensive interventions targeting the entire at-risk population, highlighting the need for locally-tailored strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches."

### Notes
- Open access (PMC) - no copyright concerns
- JHEEM model (Johns Hopkins HIV Economic-Epidemiologic Model)
- Covers all 32 EHE priority metropolitan statistical areas
- Interactive web tool available at www.jheem.org
- Published in high-impact journal (Annals of Internal Medicine)
- Key conclusion (page 9): "Large reductions in HIV incidence are achievable with substantial investment, but the EHE goals will be difficult to achieve in most locations"
- Emphasizes local heterogeneity - different cities need different strategies
- Does NOT account for COVID-19 pandemic effects (limitation noted)
